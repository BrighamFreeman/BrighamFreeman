## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Brigham, a data scientist and ML Engineer. I enjoy being able to find the intersection between math and business, solving real-world problems with highly technical, deep solutions. I have a strong background in academic settings (you can read some of my physics research in the ChuaChaosDetection repo). Most of the repos on my page are backups of data science projects I have either worked on in the past, or am currently working on. I have applied many cutting edge frameworks, such as WGAN-GP, RNN, and Agentic Frameworks. Feel free to check out some of the code for inspiration, or see how technical solutions can solve real-world problems.
